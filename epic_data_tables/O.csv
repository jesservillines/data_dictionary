None / Other When a prescription is filled in an integrated pharmacy, a fill contact is created in the order and all fill information is saved to this fill contact. A prescription can have multiple fills. This is the actual amount unit the pharmacy is dispensing. The actual amount dispensed from the pharmacy could be different from the intended quantity, which is what the prescriber intended the patient to receive. The two numbers may be different in the case the patient can only pay for a smaller supply, or the pharmacy may only have a small amount of the medication left to dispense.
